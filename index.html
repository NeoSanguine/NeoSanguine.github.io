                I have been looking into SDL recently and have begun trying to learn the syntax. I have been reading into Shaun Micheal's SDL Book and found
                it to be very helpful. Except for the fact that he often ask you to refer to the source code, and if you are not signed up with the publisher. Then you do
                not have access to it which could be annoying for some.

                I am currently working on a 2D platformer game with a kind of throwback mario style gameplay. <em>waits for the out cry</em>. I am currently looking for another artist if anyone is interested. Just be aware there isn't any plans to make money off of this. Simply just for fun/learning experience.
                If you are still interested contact me through git.
